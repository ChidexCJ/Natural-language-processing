NLTK was applied in feature engineering on a movie review dataset, whose text variable is the "Review" and a target variable of "Rating".
The dataset was engineered further to create a new column "Sentiment" from the Rating column, scores above 3.5 were assigned class 1 while below 3.5 were assigned class 0.
Passive Aggressive Classifier algorithm was applied in model development.
Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique was used in class imblance handling.
